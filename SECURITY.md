# Security Documentation — csoh.org

This document describes the security measures in place for [csoh.org](https://csoh.org), a static website for the Cloud Security Office Hours community.

---

## Architecture

csoh.org is a **pure static site** — no server-side code, no database, no user accounts, no cookies, no sessions. This eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities (SQL injection, RCE, auth bypass, session hijacking, CSRF). Content is served from shared hosting (LiteSpeed) with FTPS deployment via GitHub Actions.

---

## HTTP Security Headers

All responses from csoh.org include these security headers, configured in both `.htaccess` (production) and `nginx.conf` (Docker/local):

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` | Forces HTTPS for 1 year, includes subdomains, eligible for browser preload lists |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevents MIME-type sniffing attacks |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Blocks clickjacking by preventing iframe embedding |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | See below | Restricts what the browser can load |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Limits referrer data sent to external sites |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=(), usb=(), magnetometer=(), gyroscope=(), accelerometer=()` | Disables all browser APIs we don't use |

Server version headers (`X-Powered-By`, `Server`) are stripped from HTTPS responses.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self';
style-src 'self';
img-src 'self' https://csoh.org https://img.youtube.com https://i.ytimg.com data:;
font-src 'self';
connect-src 'self';
frame-src https://www.youtube.com https://web.archive.org https://www.wired.com;
frame-ancestors 'none';
base-uri 'self';
form-action 'self';
object-src 'none'
```

Key points:
- **No `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`** in `script-src` — inline scripts and `eval()` are blocked
- **No wildcards** — every external domain is explicitly listed
- **`frame-ancestors 'none'`** — supersedes `X-Frame-Options` for modern browsers
- **`object-src 'none'`** — blocks Flash, Java applets, and other plugin content
- Only YouTube and Web Archive are allowed as iframe sources
- Only YouTube thumbnail domains are allowed as external image sources

---

## File Access Controls

The `.htaccess` and `nginx.conf` block direct access to sensitive files:

| Pattern | Status | What's blocked |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| `^\.` (hidden files) | 403 | `.git/`, `.env`, `.htaccess`, `.claude/`, etc. |
| `\.git(/.*)?$` | 403 | Git repository data |
| `\.(py\|pyc\|md\|json)$` | 403 | Python scripts, docs, JSON files |
| `.*-report\.txt$` | 403 | Internal URL safety report files |
| `\.(bak\|config\|sh\|sql\|log\|ini)$` | 403 | Backups, configs, scripts, logs |

**Exceptions:** `preview-mapping.json` is explicitly allowed because the site's JavaScript needs to fetch it.

Directory listing is disabled globally (`Options -Indexes` / `autoindex off`).

---

## Subresource Integrity (SRI)

All first-party CSS and JavaScript files include SRI hashes:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css?v=50dcc027"
    integrity="sha384-vK2hvLkL0HnH9vJgt/...">
<script src="/main.js?v=a1b2c3d4"
    integrity="sha384-xyz123..."></script>
```

The `update_sri.py` script:
1. Calculates SHA-384 hashes for every tracked first-party asset (`style.css`, `main.js`, `chat-resources.js`, `breach-timeline.css`, `breach-timeline.js`, `meetings.js`, `glossary.js`)
2. Updates the `integrity` attribute in all HTML files
3. Adds cache-busting `?v=` parameters derived from the hash
4. Runs automatically in CI before every deploy

This means even if the hosting account were compromised and files were tampered with, browsers would refuse to execute the modified scripts.

---

## JavaScript Security

**XSS Prevention:**
- All user input (search queries, URL parameters) is passed through a `sanitize()` function that uses `textContent` encoding — the safest DOM-based sanitization method
- No `eval()`, no `document.write()`, no `Function()` constructors
- `innerHTML` is only used with sanitized or non-user-controlled content

**External Link Protection:**
- All `target="_blank"` links automatically receive `rel="noopener noreferrer"` via JavaScript enforcement on page load
- This prevents reverse tabnapping attacks

**No Third-Party JavaScript:**
- Zero external scripts — no analytics, no tracking pixels, no CDN-hosted libraries
- All JavaScript is first-party, self-hosted, and SRI-hashed

**No Cookies or Tracking:**
- The site sets no cookies of any kind
- `localStorage` is used only for the dark mode theme preference (`theme` key)
- No user data is collected, stored, or transmitted
- See [privacy.html](privacy.html) for the user-facing Privacy Policy

---

## URL Safety Validation

An automated URL safety checker runs in CI on every HTML change:

1. **Trigger:** Any push or PR that modifies `.html` files
2. **Scan:** Extracts all URLs from all HTML files (href, src, embedded)
3. **Checks performed:**
   - URL scheme validation (only `http://` and `https://` allowed)
   - Known phishing pattern detection (login spoofing, credential harvesting keywords)
   - URL shortener detection (`bit.ly`, `goo.gl`, `tinyurl.com`, etc.)
   - Suspicious TLD detection (`.tk`, `.ml`, `.ga`, etc.)
   - Raw IP address detection
   - Excessive subdomain detection
   - Domain length anomaly detection
4. **Result:** If any URL is classified as **unsafe**, the workflow exits with code 1 and blocks the merge
5. **Whitelisted domains:** github.com, youtube.com, aws.amazon.com, owasp.org, cisa.gov, nist.gov, csoh.org, microsoft.com, google.com, cloudflare.com, wikipedia.org

See `tools/CHECK_URL_SAFETY_README.md` for full details.

## Supply Chain Security

### Pinned GitHub Actions

All third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to exact commit SHAs rather than mutable version tags. This prevents a compromised action maintainer from injecting malicious code via a tag update.

| Action | Pinned SHA | Version |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `actions/checkout` | `de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd` | v6.0.2 |
| `actions/setup-python` | `a309ff8b426b58ec0e2a45f0f869d46889d02405` | v6.2.0 |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | `bbbca2ddaa5d8feaa63e36b76fdaad77386f024f` | v7.0.0 |
| `actions/github-script` | `ed597411d8f924073f98dfc5c65a23a2325f34cd` | v8.0.0 |
| `actions/create-github-app-token` | `1b10c78c7865c340bc4f6099eb2f838309f1e8c3` | v3.1.1 |
| `peter-evans/create-pull-request` | `c0f553fe549906ede9cf27b5156039d195d2ece0` | v8.1.0 |
| `peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge` | `a660677d5469627102a1c1e11409dd063606628d` | v3.0.0 |
| `raven-actions/actionlint` | `205b530c5d9fa8f44ae9ed59f341a0db994aa6f8` | v2.1.2 |
| `astral-sh/ruff-action` | `0ce1b0bf8b818ef400413f810f8a11cdbda0034b` | v4.0.0 |
| `lycheeverse/lychee-action` | `8646ba30535128ac92d33dfc9133794bfdd9b411` | v2.8.0 |
| `Cyb3r-Jak3/html5validator-action` | `443b108eb8e134b63a1f8a8ba0c942d552608ed7` | master 2025-09-19 |

To update a pinned action, look up the commit SHA for the new tag:
```bash
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/git/ref/tags/v6.0.2" | grep sha
```

The one exception is `actions/cache@v4` (used in `check-broken-links.yml`), which is currently pinned to a major-version tag rather than a SHA — tracked for tightening.

### No External Dependencies (Client-Side)

The site loads zero external JavaScript libraries, CSS frameworks, or fonts. Everything is self-hosted. This eliminates CDN compromise as an attack vector.

### Minimal Python Dependencies

The CI tooling uses only:
- Python standard library (`urllib`, `hashlib`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`)
- `Playwright` (for screenshot generation)
- `Pillow` (for image optimization)
- `yamllint` (lint job, pinned version)

---

## CI/CD Authentication

CI workflows authenticate to GitHub via a **GitHub App** (`csoh-ci`) rather than a personal access token. This section explains the model, the migration rationale, and what's still on a PAT.

### Authentication model

| Workflow | Auth | Pushes to main? |
|----------|------|------|
| `update-news.yml` | `csoh-ci` App + `CSOH_PAT` (for auto-approve) | via PR + auto-merge |
| `normalize-urls.yml` | `csoh-ci` App | via PR (human reviews + merges) |
| `site-update-deploy.yml` | `csoh-ci` App | direct (App is on ruleset bypass) |
| `manual-deploy.yml` | none (FTP only) | no |
| `lint.yml`, `validate-html.yml`, `check-broken-links.yml`, `check-url-safety.yml` | auto-injected `GITHUB_TOKEN` | no |

Every workflow declares an explicit top-level `permissions:` block scoping the auto-injected `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The four read-only check workflows use `contents: read` (plus `pull-requests: write` where they post comments). The four write-capable workflows (`update-news`, `normalize-urls`, `site-update-deploy`, `manual-deploy`) declare `contents: read` for the auto-injected token, because they handle write access through the App or PAT instead — keeping the default token strictly minimal.

### Why we migrated from PATs to a GitHub App

The original CI design used two personal access tokens belonging to a human (Shawn): `PAT_TOKEN` (push, open PRs, enable auto-merge) and `APPROVAL_PAT_TOKEN` (approve the bot's own PRs, since GitHub blocks self-approval with the same identity). PATs are functional but carry several security properties we wanted to improve:

1. **Long-lived.** PATs don't expire unless you set an explicit expiry. Once granted, the token is valid until manually revoked. A leaked PAT remains useful to an attacker for as long as it takes you to notice.

2. **Broadly scoped (classic PATs especially).** A classic PAT with `repo` scope can read and write *every* repository the owning user has access to — public, private, and forked. Even fine-grained PATs are awkward to constrain to one repository while still permitting all the operations a busy CI pipeline needs.

3. **Tied to a personal identity.** Bot commits authored under a PAT show up as the human account on the audit log, blurring the distinction between automation and operator action. If the human leaves the project (or the org), every workflow that depends on their PAT breaks.

4. **No native rotation.** Rotating a PAT means generating a new one, updating every secret, and revoking the old one — a manual process that tends to get postponed.

A GitHub App fixes all four:

1. **Short-lived tokens.** The App's installation tokens are valid for ~1 hour. A workflow run requests a fresh token at job start; that token is the only thing exposed to the workflow log redaction layer. After the run finishes, the token is useless.

2. **Per-repo scoping by default.** The App is installed on the single `CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org` repository with the minimum permissions needed (`contents: read+write`, `pull-requests: read+write`). The token GitHub mints from those install settings cannot do more than the App's installation scope allows.

3. **Independent identity.** The App is its own first-class GitHub principal (`csoh-ci[bot]`). Audit logs cleanly distinguish bot pushes from human pushes. The App outlives any individual contributor.

4. **Automatic rotation.** Tokens rotate every hour with no human intervention. The only long-lived secret is the App's RSA private key, which only needs rotating when you suspect it's compromised (or as part of a periodic key-rotation hygiene pass).

In numbers: blast radius of a leaked CI token went from "everything Shawn's PAT can touch, until manual revocation" → "one repo, one workflow run's worth of actions, ~1 hour."

### App configuration

- **Installation:** `csoh-ci` is installed on `CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org` only — not at the org-wide level.
- **Repository permissions:** `contents: read & write`, `pull-requests: read & write`. No other permissions granted.
- **Webhooks:** disabled. The App is purely an authentication identity; it does not consume events.
- **Branch protection / rulesets:** `csoh-ci` is on the main-branch ruleset bypass list with mode "Always," because `site-update-deploy.yml` does direct in-place commits to `main` (with `[skip ci]` markers) for housekeeping (SRI hashes, sitemap dates, normalized URLs, generated preview images). PRs from `update-news.yml` and `normalize-urls.yml` go through the normal merge path and don't need the bypass.

### Token retrieval pattern

Every workflow that needs write access starts with the same step:

```yaml
- name: Mint installation token
  id: app-token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@1b10c78c7865c340bc4f6099eb2f838309f1e8c3  # v3.1.1
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.CSOH_CI_CLIENT_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.CSOH_CI_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Subsequent steps reference `${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}` wherever they previously used `${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}` (e.g., `actions/checkout`'s `token:` input, `peter-evans/create-pull-request`'s `token:` input, `git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:${TOKEN}@..."`).

### Why one PAT remains: GitHub auto-merge does not honor ruleset bypass

GitHub does not allow an actor to approve its own PRs (this restriction applies to GitHub Apps too — an App that opens a PR cannot approve it). The main-branch ruleset has a `pull_request` rule requiring 1 approval before merging.

We initially expected that putting the `csoh-ci` App on the ruleset's **bypass list** with mode `Always` would let the App auto-merge its own PRs without any approval — the bypass should apply to *all* rules including `pull_request`, and the merge action is performed by the App. **Empirically, this is not the case.** Verified on 2026-05-08 with PR #650:

- All required status checks: passing
- App on bypass list with `mode: always`
- Auto-merge enabled by the App
- Result: `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED`, `reviewDecision: REVIEW_REQUIRED` — auto-merge sat indefinitely

GitHub's auto-merge feature evaluates `reviewDecision` independently and does not consult the bypass list. (Bypass *does* work for direct API merges by the same actor — it's specific to the auto-merge scheduler.) So one narrow PAT remains: `CSOH_PAT`, a fine-grained org-scoped token used exclusively to approve PRs that the App has just opened, satisfying the approval rule so that auto-merge can fire.

`normalize-urls.yml` keeps its "human reviews + merges" flow without an auto-approve step; the auto-approve there was a one-click convenience and added no real safety. Removing it is a strict improvement (humans now click both "approve" and "merge" instead of just "merge").

`site-update-deploy.yml` is unaffected — it does direct in-place commits to `main` (not via PR), and the App's bypass *does* apply to direct pushes.

### Repository secrets currently in use

| Secret | Purpose | Type |
|--------|---------|------|
| `CSOH_CI_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub App's Client ID (`Iv23.*`) | identifier (not sensitive on its own) |
| `CSOH_CI_PRIVATE_KEY` | GitHub App's RSA private key | high-sensitivity |
| `CSOH_PAT` | Approve App-opened PRs (auto-merge driver) | medium-sensitivity (narrow scope) |
| `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USER`, `FTP_PASS` | FTPS deploy credentials | high-sensitivity |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Reserved for future use | high-sensitivity |

`PAT_TOKEN` (the original CI PAT), `CSOH_CI_APP_ID` (deprecated numeric input, replaced by `CSOH_CI_CLIENT_ID`), and `APPROVAL_PAT_TOKEN` (replaced by `CSOH_PAT`) have all been removed.

`CSOH_PAT` is a **fine-grained PAT** scoped to `CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org` only, with permissions limited to **Pull requests: Read & Write** (no contents, no actions, no anything else). Even if it leaks, the only damage an attacker can do is approve PRs — they cannot push, merge by themselves, or read code beyond what's already in the public repo. Replaced the broader classic-PAT `APPROVAL_PAT_TOKEN` on 2026-05-08.

### Rotation guidance

| Item | Rotation cadence | Process |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| App installation token | Automatic, every ~1 hour | None — handled by GitHub |
| App private key | Annually or on suspected compromise | Generate new key in App settings; replace `CSOH_CI_PRIVATE_KEY` secret; revoke old key |
| `CSOH_PAT` | Every 6–12 months (or before its set expiry) | Generate new fine-grained PAT (resource owner: `CloudSecurityOfficeHours`, repo: `csoh.org`, permission: pull-requests: write only); replace org-level Actions secret |
| `FTP_PASS` | Every 6–12 months | Rotate via hosting panel; replace secret |

## Deployment Security

### FTPS Deployment

The site deploys via FTPS (FTP over TLS) using `lftp` from GitHub Actions:
- `ftp:ssl-force true` — enforces TLS encryption on the data channel
- `ftp:ssl-protect-data true` — encrypts file transfers, not just the control channel
- Credentials are stored as GitHub repository secrets (`FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USER`, `FTP_PASS`)

The deploy workflow (`site-update-deploy.yml`) authenticates to GitHub via the `csoh-ci` App for its housekeeping commits (SRI hash updates, sitemap refreshes, etc.) — see [CI/CD Authentication](#cicd-authentication) above. FTP credentials are entirely separate and not affected by App-token rotation.

### Deployment Exclusions

The following are explicitly excluded from deployment to the web server:

| Excluded | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `.git/` | Repository data |
| `.github/` | CI/CD workflows |
| `.venv/` | Python virtual environment |
| `__pycache__/` | Python bytecode cache |
| `tools/` | Internal tooling scripts |
| `*.sh`, `*.py`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo` | Scripts |
| `*.md` | Documentation files |
| `.DS_Store` | macOS metadata |
| `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING*.md` | Repo docs |

### Docker Security

The `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` provide an alternative deployment path with equivalent security:
- All sensitive files are removed during the Docker build (`rm -rf .git, tools, *.py, *.md`, etc.)
- `nginx.conf` mirrors all `.htaccess` security headers and access controls
- `server_tokens off` suppresses nginx version disclosure

---

## Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability on csoh.org:

- **Email:** admin@csoh.org
- **security.txt:** https://csoh.org/.well-known/security.txt (RFC 9116)
- **Community:** Bring it up during our Friday Zoom session

We take security seriously — especially as a cloud security community.

---

## Known Limitations

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| FTP cert verification disabled | Accepted risk | `ssl:verify-certificate no` is set because the server lacks an FQDN-matching certificate. TLS encryption is still enforced. |
| `Server: LiteSpeed` on HTTP redirect | Hosting limitation | The HTTP (port 80) redirect response leaks the server type. The HTTPS response correctly strips it. Requires hosting panel config to suppress. |
| `www.csoh.org` no canonical redirect | Hosting limitation | `www.csoh.org` serves content directly instead of redirecting to `csoh.org`. Requires DNS/hosting config. |
| `http://flaws.cloud` link | Intentional | This AWS security training site only serves over HTTP. The link is intentional. |
