# `crosslink_pages.py`

Cross-link glossary terms across the rest of the site.

## What it does

For each content page (everything except `glossary.html`), the script finds the **first occurrence** of each glossary term and wraps it in an anchor pointing to the glossary entry:

```html
<a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html#term-cspm">CSPM</a>
```

This is the cross-page companion to [`crosslink_glossary.py`](CROSSLINK_GLOSSARY_README.md), which only links terms *within* `glossary.html`.

## Usage

```bash
python3 tools/crosslink_pages.py
```

The script is **idempotent** - every run strips existing cross-page glossary links and rebuilds them, so adding new glossary entries or tuning the denylist is safe to re-run.

## Where links go

The list of target pages is at the top of `crosslink_pages.py` in `TARGET_PAGES`. Add new pages there as the site grows.

The glossary itself, error pages (`403.html`, `404.html`), and the Google site verification stub are deliberately excluded.

## Linking rules

- **First occurrence per page only.** Subsequent mentions of the same term on the same page are not linked, to keep prose readable.
- **Acronyms (all-caps, 2–8 chars) match case-sensitively.** This prevents `cd` (the shell command) from matching `CD` (Continuous Delivery), `Kev` (a person's name) from matching `KEV` (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities), etc. Multi-word and lowercase glossary entries continue to match case-insensitively.
- **Skip zones** - the linker never touches text inside any of these:
  - existing `<a>` tags (no double-linking)
  - `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<script>`, `<style>`
  - `<h1>` through `<h6>` (headings shouldn't get inline links)
  - `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` (chrome, not content)
  - HTML comments, attribute values, JSON-LD schema blocks
- **DENYLIST** filters single-word terms that overlap with ordinary English (`public`, `data`, `cloud`, `agent`, etc.) plus single-word remnants accidentally extracted from compound entries like `Blue / Red Team`. If a generic word starts auto-linking somewhere unhelpful, add it to the `DENYLIST` set near the top of the script.

## When to run it

- After adding or editing glossary terms (so new terms get cross-linked from existing pages).
- After adding a new content page (add the page name to `TARGET_PAGES` first).
- If you notice false-positive links and update the `DENYLIST`.

## Output

```
Loaded 201 unique glossary terms (338 aliases).
    index.html: stripped 0, linked 0
    resources.html: stripped 1, linked 1 (AI)

The trailing parenthesized list shows which terms were linked on each page so you can spot any unwanted matches.

## Relationship to `crosslink_glossary.py`

| Script | Operates on | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| `crosslink_glossary.py` | `glossary.html` only | `<a class="glossary-link" href="#term-...">` (anchor-only, intra-page) |
| `crosslink_pages.py` | All content pages | `<a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html#term-...">` (cross-page) |

Both share the same `derive_keys` and slugification logic and use the same `glossary-link` class so they look identical in the DOM.
